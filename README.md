## Investigating and predicting use of the TfL Cycle Hire Scheme

### Project undertaken while studying Data Science at General Assembly, London.

#### Data search and collation

The original datasets came from various sources found online, including:

[https://data.london.gov.uk/](London Datastore)

[https://api.tfl.gov.uk/](TfL API)

[https://rp5.ru/](RP5 Weather)

[https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/]('What Do They Know' FOI Requests)

[http://astro.ukho.gov.uk/](Her Majesty's Nautical Almanac Office)

[https://www.feiertagskalender.ch/](Holiday Calendars)

Some cleaning and basic editing of a few of the files was carried out in spreadsheets. Subsequently the scripts in the **data-prep** directory have been run, to produce the collated output found in the **data** folder. 

I hope to automate the collection and cleaning of the raw data or provide instructions so that the process can be replicated in full. 

For now, all of the collated data required for the primary notebooks (those in the root directory) is on GitHub in the data folder. 

### These notebooks can be viewed and run via Binder:

##### This may take a minute or so to build.
