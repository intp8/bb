## Investigating and predicting use of the TfL Cycle Hire Scheme

### Project undertaken while studying Data Science at General Assembly, London.

#### Primary notebooks

Summary of the notebooks in the root directory:
- Long-term London trends

#### These notebooks can be viewed and run via Binder:

It may take a minute or so to build the repo for interactivity.

All of the collated data required for the primary notebooks is in the **data** directory. 

#### Data search and collation

The original datasets came from various sources found online, including:

[https://data.london.gov.uk/] (London Datastore)

[https://api.tfl.gov.uk/] (TfL API)

[https://rp5.ru/] (RP5 Weather)

[https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/] ('What Do They Know' FOI Requests)

[http://astro.ukho.gov.uk/] (Her Majesty's Nautical Almanac Office)

[https://www.feiertagskalender.ch/] (Holiday Calendars)

Some cleaning and basic editing of a few of the files was carried out in spreadsheets. Subsequently the notebooks in the **data-prep** directory have been run to produce the collated output in the **data** directory used by the primary notebooks. 

I hope to automate the collection and cleaning of the raw data or provide instructions so that the process can be replicated in full. 

Please contact me if you would like the raw-data required by the data-prep files and I can make it available or point you to the sources.
